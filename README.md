Welcome to **AoCPython**, a repository dedicated to my solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles. Every year, the Advent of Code provides a set of daily programming challenges in December, encouraging participants to learn, solve, and have fun. This repository will serve as my personal journey of tackling those challenges in Python.

## üéÑ Advent of Code 2024

Advent of Code is an annual series of programming puzzles that become available from December 1st through 25th. The problems vary in difficulty and cover different aspects of computer science, mathematics, and logic, providing an excellent opportunity to practice coding, debugging, and thinking creatively.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Python**: All solutions are written in Python, leveraging its versatility and extensive libraries.

## üìÅ Repository Structure
The repository is structured by year and day of the challenge. For example:

```
AoCPython/
  |
  |-- 2024/
       |-- Day01/
           |-- Run.py
           |-- data-day01.txt
       |-- Day02/
           |-- solution.py
           |-- input.txt
       ...
```

- **`Run.py`**: The Python file that contains my code for solving the day's puzzle.
- **`data.txt`**: The puzzle input for that specific day.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To run the solutions:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/AoCPython.git
   cd AoCPython
   ```

2. Navigate to a specific day's folder and run the solution script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## ‚ú® Solutions Overview
This section will include a summary of each day's solution, highlighting interesting challenges, techniques used, and any learnings or reflections. (I'll update this as I go along!)

## üìñ Learnings & Reflections
Advent of Code is a great way to learn new problem-solving techniques and improve programming skills. Throughout this repository, I plan to document my thoughts and approaches to each problem, including challenges I faced and how I solved them. Feel free to explore my code and leave any comments or suggestions!

## ü§ù Contributions
This repository is my personal playground for AoC, but I'm always open to discussions, improvements, and collaborations. If you have a better approach or would like to discuss a solution, feel free to open an issue or start a discussion.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
The solutions provided here are intended for learning and reference purposes. If you are participating in the Advent of Code event and have stumbled upon this repo, I encourage you to try the problems on your own before looking at my solutions. That's where the real fun and learning happens! üòä

## üìß Contact
If you want to get in touch, feel free to reach out via GitHub or leave comments here.

## üéâ Happy Coding!
Good luck to all who are attempting the Advent of Code! I hope you enjoy solving the puzzles as much as I do.
